# Critical Issues Fixed

This document outlines the critical issues identified by Application Signals investigation and their fixes.

## Issues Identified

### 1. SQS Rate Limiting (PurgeQueueInProgressException)
**Problem**: The service was hitting SQS purge queue rate limits (60-second restriction) causing 3,141-3,714 WebClientResponseException occurrences.

**Root Cause**: Frequent purge operations in `SqsService.sendMsg()` method without respecting AWS rate limits.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added cooldown mechanism with 65-second minimum interval between purge operations
- Implemented proper error handling to prevent cascading failures
- Added logging to indicate when purge operations are skipped
- Recommended using message visibility timeout or DLQ instead of frequent purges

### 2. Database Stack Overflow (Hibernate HQL)
**Problem**: StackOverflowError in Hibernate HQL processing during `OwnerRepository.deleteAllInBatch` operations.

**Root Cause**: Large batch operations without size limits causing infinite recursion in HQL logical expression processing.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added maximum batch size limit (100 records per operation)
- Implemented pagination using `PageRequest` to limit query results
- Changed from `deleteAllInBatch()` to individual `delete()` operations to avoid batch issues
- Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added `@Transactional` annotation for proper transaction management

### 3. High Error Rates and Latency
**Problem**: High latency (1,367ms+) and 2.44% fault rate with cascading failures.

**Root Cause**: Inadequate circuit breaker configuration allowing failures to cascade.

**Fix Applied**:
- Improved circuit breaker configuration with:
  - 50% failure rate threshold (down from default)
  - 30-second wait duration in open state
  - Sliding window of 10 calls for failure calculation
  - Slow call detection (>2 seconds considered slow)
  - Reduced timeout to 3 seconds for fail-fast behavior
  - Automatic transition from open to half-open state

## Files Modified

1. **SqsService.java**: Fixed SQS rate limiting issues
2. **OwnerResource.java**: Fixed database stack overflow and batch operation issues  
3. **ApiGatewayApplication.java**: Improved circuit breaker configuration

## Expected Improvements

- **SQS Errors**: Elimination of PurgeQueueInProgressException errors
- **Database Performance**: Prevention of stack overflow errors during batch operations
- **Service Reliability**: Reduced error rates through better circuit breaker protection
- **Latency**: Faster failure detection and recovery through improved timeouts
- **Cascading Failures**: Better isolation of failures between services

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Monitor SQS queue metrics for purge operation frequency
2. Track database batch operation performance and error rates
3. Monitor circuit breaker state transitions and failure rates
4. Set up alerts for stack overflow errors and high latency operations
5. Review Application Signals dashboards for improvement validation

## Additional Considerations

- Consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Evaluate using AWS SQS Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) instead of frequent purge operations
- Consider database connection pooling optimization for high-load scenarios
- Implement health checks for better service discovery reliability
